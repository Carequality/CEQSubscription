### Triggering Events for Each Notification Type

Asserting that you support a Notification Type means that agree to abide by that Notification Typeâ€™s specific policies and requirements.

#### Admission

#### Discharge
Push Notification Implementers should use the same criteria for the Discharge trigger that they use for meaningful use reporting.  (i.e., patient's status is changed to "discharged"). Notes, such as Against Medical Advice, are included in or attached to the resulting Encounter Resource.

#### Transfer
Transfer Type 1: When a transfer is ordered to any external (any location that would not trigger an internal Admit notification) location. For example
* Any transfer that crosses between EHRs (even when internal to one organization) shall generate a notification; and/or
* Any transfer within a system that crosses between settings (ED, Skilled Nursing, etc.) shall generate a notification.

Transfer Type 2: Any time a transfer order is generated.
