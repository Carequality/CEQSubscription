* Based on the Use Case Proposal, Notification Types define:
  * What information is sent
  * Policies around who is able to subscribe and when
  * What triggers are used
  * Technical Specifications
Asserting that you support a Notification Type means that agree to abide by that Notification Typeâ€™s specific policies and requirements

### Triggering Events for Each Notification Type
#### Discharge
Push Notification Implementers should use the same criteria for the Discharge Trigger that they use for meaningful use reporting.

#### Admission
When a patient has been checked into the EHR system.  Codes vary by location

#### Discharge
When a patient has left the facility.  Notes, such as Against Medical Advice, are included in the resulting Encounter Resource

#### Referrals
Only applies to Secondary Referrals.  Internal consults are not included.

#### Transfer
Push Notification Implementers should use the same criteria for the Transfer Trigger that they use for meaningful use reporting.

#### Gaps in Care
Parameters: Set by the Implementers
