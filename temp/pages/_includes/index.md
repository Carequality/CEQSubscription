# Introduction
## Goals
* Remove the need to poll for solicited:
 * High-frequency events.
 * High-urgency events.
* Allow clients to discover missed events.
* Ensure a “low bar” for server and client implementation.
* Consider security, confidentiality, and scale during design.

NOT focused on unsolicited notifications
* Project results may be useful as a building block or launching point

## Topic
* Is a well-defined event: ‘admission’, ‘discharge’, ‘gap in care' , etc.
* Servers choose which Topics to support.

## Subscription
* Is a request for notifications based on a one or more Topics.

## Notification
* Is a simple http 'knock' using POST and the FullURL of the Encounter resource created

## Security Notes
* It is beyond the scope of this project to define security and authentication procedures. Please see the Carequality FHIR Implementation Guide at [LINK] for details on Registration and Authorization
* Servers should perform authorization checks prior to creating a Subscription to ensure it is valid.
