Carequality has defined a custom flow for a Subscription that removes the criteria use
in favour of specific events defined as URIs.  This adds requirements that the PatientID
and an identifier be added to the resource.  The identifier element is the endpoint id
[Base]/fhir/Subscription/[identifier]
A termination (Subscription.end) date is required and may not be more than 2 years from date of subscription without renewal.</li>
