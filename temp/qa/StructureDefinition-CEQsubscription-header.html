<p>Extended Elements and Constraints Specific to the Carequality Use Case
Carequality has defined a custom flow for a Subscription that removes the criteria use
in favour of specific events defined as URIs.  This adds requirements that the PatientID
and an identifier be added to the resource.  The identifier element is the endpoint id
[Base]/fhir/Subscription/[identifier]</p>
